# SQL-demand-forecasting
My first project  for forecasting demand and managing inventory with SQL

# SQL Demand Forecasting and Inventory Control

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to forecast product demand and manage inventory using SQL. The project involves creating a database, inserting sample data, performing demand forecasting using simple techniques such as moving averages, and managing inventory based on the forecasted demand.

The SQL queries included in this project are designed to:
- Calculate forecasted demand based on historical sales data.
- Manage inventory levels and suggest restocking when needed.
  
### Key Features
- **Demand Forecasting**: Forecast product demand based on historical sales data.
- **Inventory Control**: Automatically checks if stock levels are sufficient or need restocking based on forecasted demand.
- **SQL Queries**: Uses SQL for creating databases, inserting data, and calculating forecasts.

Output

    The forecasted demand might show the average sales over the past 3 days for each product.
    The inventory control query will list products where stock levels are below the forecasted demand, suggesting restocking.

Future Improvements

    Implement more advanced forecasting techniques such as exponential smoothing or linear regression.
    Add features for automated inventory restocking based on forecasted demand.
    Include more detailed reports and data visualizations (using tools like Tableau or Power BI).
